Lacking flesh, this undead monstrosity is a macabre assembly of bones, held together with cursed magic. It's empty eye sockets glow with malevolent energy, eflecting the purpose of it's creator. Skeletons wield spectral weapons with surprising precision and are often cloaked in tattered remnants of armor, evidence of what they wore in life. Animated by dark Magic, the skeleton is an unholy guardian tirelessly patroling the crypts and cursed domains it watches over.",
    "Ghoul":"The Ghoul is an inquisitive one, with a thirst for knowledge that rivals their love for battle. They're the kind of warrior who can discuss poetry as deftly as they can swing a sword.They know that true Mastery of the Blade requires a deep understanding of the world around them. They use their intellect to gain the upper hand in battles of wit and diplomacy. A master of tactics and culture. In a world where brawn often reigns supreme, the erudite samurai is a rare and valuable gem, a warrior who values knowledge and wisdom as highly as strength and skill.",
    "Zombie":"The Zombie, a scoundrel of the highest order, has forsaken all traditional honour. Instead, they use their stealth and guile to weave a web of deceit, assassinating their prey from the shadows. No lord or clan can control this wily fiend, for their only true master is their own greed. Their blades are sharp, their wits sharper, and their hearts as black as the night they stalk. They are the shadow that creeps up behind you, the serpent that slithers beneath your feet. Cross them at your own peril, for they are the Zombie, and their loyalty is to only themselves.",

The sacrifice can be anything from losing d4 HP to discarding an important item. The next time the Ronin attacks with the blade, they roll twice and take the higher roll, the strike deals an extra d8 damage.
