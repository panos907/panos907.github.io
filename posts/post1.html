            <p class="m-2">Gosh, it's been years ever since i sat down and just wrote my thoughts on paper.
              Well, digital "paper" in this case but still paper in a way. Feels like life is pretty stable and pretty good these days,
              yet i still seem to get kinda irked at the slightest last-minute change of plans.
            </p>
            <p class="m-2">At least, work is going well, the hobbies are relatively stable, and i seem to be able to provide for myself quite well with minimal external help,
              which i thought was going to be MUCH harder when i moved out alone about a year ago.</p>
