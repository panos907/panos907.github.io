            <p class="m-2">Finally getting down to playing some more games these days, and i am constantly blown away by how good PSP games look played on original hardware even in 2024.
              I never owned one of these guys back in the day, and was gifted one by an ex around 2019 or so, played a few hours, and left it in a drawer.
            </p>
            <p class="m-2">
              However, recently i dusted it off, and started playing some stuff again, mainly Burnout Dominator and a bit of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite.
              And although the ergonomics are bad, and the controls feel kinda mushy sometimes, the design of the device, the XMB (the operating system/menu design) and the sheer early 2000s charm oozing from the device keep pulling me in.
              I am also VERY amazed at the variety of the library, filled with quality games, from racing, to RPGs and Action games. Also the fact that a lot of them have actual 3D graphics of PS2-kinda quality, must be doing something to my early 2000s brain that grew up on a PS2.
            </p>
            <p class="m-2">
              For some reason, i seem to gravitate towards portables more than PC/consoles these days. I guess part of it has to do with the fact that i work on the computer for 8 hours a day as a software engineer.
              But whatever the reason may be, the PSP is doing a wonderful job with filling that void!
            </p>
            <p class="m-2">
              On a slightly unrelated note, i never thought i would actually be playing Monster Hunter Freedom Unite on the actual hardware, let alone enjoying it so much!
              I think it's partly because there's no upscaling going on, so all the graphics, textures etc are as they should be, and partly because i just love the old-school MH more than i care to admit to myself. It has a very 2000s vibe to it, where you just play the game and keep grinding ahead in a very "unforgiving way" that feels very cathartic somehow.
