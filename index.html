               This is my own little corner of the internet, where i write about what's on my head, and maybe share some insight into my everyday life!
            </h3>
            <p class="m-2">I was inspired to make this by a certain Youtube video, which you can see <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNlZ50b6wSs" class="link">here</a></strong>.</p>
            <p class="m-2">Some of it was my desire to fight back against the "productivity" pressure i was feeling from various sources, </p>
            <p class="m-2">But also, it was partly created for me to use as a diary, and partly so i could explore HTML and Bootstrap 5 more, to go back to a more vanilla, simpler internet,
              when we didn't care as much about looks, engagement or websites being appealing.
            </p>
            <h3>I invite you to have a look around!</h3>
            <p class="m-2">I will be uploading various stuff in the Blog tab whenever inspiration and/or the mood strikes. Till then, happy browsing, and go make your own website!</p>
            <h3>A few words about me</h3>
